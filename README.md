# ChatApplication

This is a basic Client -Serrver architecture based Chat Application , using OOPs concepts such as Multi-Threading, Networking, Socket Programming and also I have used Swing and AWT concepts for building the GUI portion.
We can access this Application in the same computer or different computer just by specifying the IP address and the port number , which is a very important thing of the connectivity of the Client-Server Application in different command prompt window .
